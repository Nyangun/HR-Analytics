HR Employee Attrition Analytics Dashboard

Overview
The HR Employee Attrition Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition within an organization. It is designed to help HR professionals and stakeholders identify key factors contributing to employee turnover and gain insights into the workforce demographics, job satisfaction, and business travel's impact on attrition.

Data Sources

The dashboard is built using HR attrition data, which includes columns such as:

Employee Demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Job Role, Department
Work Attributes: Business Travel Frequency, Job Satisfaction, Over Time, Performance Rating
Attrition: Status of employee (Attrition/No Attrition)
Job-Related Factors: Years at Company, Years in Current Role, Number of Companies Worked

Key Features

This section displays the total number of employees (1,470), the count of employees who left the company (237), the current active employees (1,233), and the average age of employees (37). The attrition rate is highlighted at 16.1%.
Attrition Based on Job Satisfaction per Role

A heatmap shows how different levels of job satisfaction (1-4) affect attrition rates across various job roles, allowing HR teams to spot trends in job satisfaction that may contribute to turnover.
Attrition Rates by Department

A pie chart displays the distribution of attrition by department. The largest proportion of attrition occurs in the R&D (56%) and Sales (39%) departments, with a smaller percentage from HR (5%).
Attrition Rates by Age Group

A bar chart visualizes attrition rates across different age groups. The 25-34 age group has the highest attrition rate, while the Over 55 age group has the lowest.
Impact of Marital Status and Business Travel Frequency on Attrition

Stacked bar charts show how marital status and business travel frequency correlate with attrition rates. For example, single employees who travel rarely have a higher attrition rate (31.6%) compared to those who do not travel (3.4%).
